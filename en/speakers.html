                            since 2007, he has been seen on district conferences quite a lot: as a contestant, as contest
                            chair, as workshop leader. His focus is on the interaction between speaker and audience. That
                            is where the magic happens. In 2016 he quit his successful job as cyber cop to become a professional
                            speaker.
