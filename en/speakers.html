                            since 2007, he has been seen on district conferences quite a lot: as a contestant, as contest

                        <h4>16:00 – 16:45 –– Saturday 14th of April </h4>  
                        <p>King Sharyar was furious: his wife had betrayed him. As revenge he married a virgin every day and had her beheaded the next day. 
                            This atrocity lasted until the daughter of the visir, Scheherazade, volunteered to be his bride. She had a plan. </p>
                        <p>Late that night she asked the king for one last wish, which was granted. Upon that she started to argue. She used <i>logic</i> to 
                            prove that his first wife was an exception. She gave <i>statistics</i> on faithfulness. She used <i>reason</i> to demonstrate where the 
                            king had gone wrong. </p>
                        <p>The next morning Scheherazade was executed. </p>
                        <p>In this workshop we will learn the power of stories: why they work, how to create them, and how to incorporate them in your speech.</p>

                            <h2>Workshop – Remember Everything: How to Build Exceptional Content One Idea at a Time </h2>
                            <h4>12:00 – 12:45 –– Saturday 14th of April </h4>  
                            <p><i>"I don't know what to write my speech about!"</i></p>
                            <p>Have you heard that before? Or maybe, have you heard yourself say that? I remember myself saying that all the time in 2012-2013, 
                                my first year in Toastmasters.</p>
                            <p>How interesting! Even in that year I was bombarded daily with surprising facts, I saw tens of great speeches and heard hundreds 
                                of stories. What I missed was a system that would allow me to find, capture and organize all the content I consumed. And so I 
                                was not able to capitalize on it.</p>
                            <p>Today - more than hundred of speeches later - things got better. I have a system that allows me organize ideas from the books I 
                                read, TED Talks I watch and even the ordinary conversations I have. It saves a lot of time - and ensures that no good idea is 
                                forgotten. The best thing about it is that is quite simple.</p>
                            <p>I will show you during the 45 minutes we will have available in this workshop.</p>

                            <h4>13:00 – 13:45 –– Saturday 14th of April </h4>  
                            <p><b>Benefits:</b> </p>
                            <p>• Learn how to make a positive first impression. </p>
                            <p>• Make your outline even more clear with the right positioning. </p>
                            <p>• Amplify your self-confidence with an appropriate stance. </p>
                            <p>• Learn how to manage small, medium, and large stages. </p>
                            <p>• Master effective usage of gestures and holograms. </p>
                            <p><b>Description:</b> Most of us are quite surprised when we see ourselves on video for the first time. Somehow our bodies convey an 
                                entirely different message than the one intended. Instead of coming off as focused, confident, and expressive, we come off 
                                as shy, tense, and intimidated. Effective body language supports our message and allows the audience to focus more intently 
                                on how and what we’re saying. The tricky thing is that we usually don’t have enough time to think body language through, as 
                                we’re too busy developing and practicing our speeches. Harness one of the most essential tools in the toastmaster’s toolbox 
                                and learn how to efficiently amplify your message, build credibility, express emotions, and make a speech come alive, through 
                                stance, gestures, and stage management.</p>

                            <h2>Workshop – Stage Manners – Skills Drills for Your Club</h2>
                            <h4>11:00 – 11:45 –– Sunday 15th of April </h4>  
                            <p>Help your club members improve their stage manners. In a typical Toastmasters meeting, the stage changes hands 30-40 times. 
                                If the transitions are awkward, you waste time and present a poor picture for members and guests. In contrast, smooth stage 
                                management makes speakers more comfortable and lets them concentrate on their speeches. This workshop is practical, hands-on 
                                training. You will learn and practice easy drills to train your club members in basic stage skills: how to get on and off stage, 
                                hand over to someone else, and handle a microphone. </p>
                            <p>The exercises in this workshop grew out of training sessions that Vera led in her club. You can use them immediately to train 
                                your own club members, improve their skills, and make your meetings more professional.</p>

                    <p>Uważam, że zanim ktokolwiek dostanie odpowiedzialność za zespół i stanie się kierownikiem tego zespołu, powinien opanować siedem 
                         podstawowych umiejętności menedżerskich. Tak się składa, że większość z tych umiejętności możesz nauczyć się w Toastmasters. 
                        Wystarczy wyjść nieco poza paradygmat naszej organizacji jako kuźni mówców i liderów. Przywództwo jest nieodzowne w prowadzeniu 
                        zespołu, ale na co dzień to właśnie te kilka podstawowych, technicznych umiejętności stanowi o tym, czy zespół „dowozi” czy nie. 
                        Po prawie dziewięciu latach w Toastmasters wiem bardzo dobrze jak wykorzystać możliwości, które stwarza ta organizacja, żeby 
                        nauczyć się jak skutecznie zarządzać zespołem. I tą wiedzą, okraszoną historiami z życia wziętymi, z radością się z Wami podzielę!</p>

                            <p><b>Prolog</b></p>
                            <p>Siedząc wraz z całą rodziną przy wigilijnym stole nie spodziewałem się tego. Trwały przyciszone rozmowy między biesiadnikami, gdy nagle wstał pan Irek i powiedział: </p>
                            <p>     - Droga rodzino! Czas teraz na tradycyjne przemówienie. Co roku ja je wygłaszam, jednak dzisiaj mamy kogoś kto nadaje się do tego zadania o wiele bardziej - spojrzał na mnie znacząco.</p>
                            <p>Byłem całkowicie zaskoczony. Czułem, że przyśpiesza mi puls, a we krwi zaczyna rosnąć poziom kortyzolu. Gorączkowo zastanawiałem się co mógłbym powiedzieć. </p>
                            <p>     - Mój wspaniały zięć chodzi do szkoły dla mówców - wyprężył się dumnie. - Dlatego czas, aby pokazał co potrafi. </p>
                            <p>Rozległy się brawa. Ze ściśniętym gardłem, powoli wstałem i przeszedłem na początek stołu. Nie wiedziałem co mam teraz zrobić. Jednocześnie nie chciałem zawieść teścia. </p>
                            <p>     Wtem do głowy przyszedł mi pewien pomysł. Przypomniała mi się pewna technika, o której kiedyś czytałem, pomagająca w wystąpieniach mówcom improwizującym. Postanowiłem ją wykorzystać - co miałem do stracenia. </p>
                            <p><b>Technika głębokich skojarzeń </b></p>
                            <p>Mówca, który improwizuje zawsze staje naprzeciw ściany "niewiadomego". Bardzo często jesteśmy zaskakiwani prośbami o wypowiedź, w najmniej oczekiwanych momentach. Jednocześnie ludzie oczekują od nas zawsze wysokiego poziomu - przecież chodzimy do "tej szkoły dla mówców".</p>
                            <p>Czy można coś z tym zrobić? Czy można przygotować się na początkową pustkę, która pojawia się po publicznie zadanym pytaniu? Czy istnieje jakaś metoda, która pomaga ad hoc budować publiczną wypowiedź, podobającą się audytorium?</p>
                            <p>Istnieje! Jest ich wiele! Ich użycie zależy od celu wypowiedzi i poziomu zaawansowania mówcy. W warsztacie, na który zapraszam wszystkim miłosników przemówień improwizowanych przedstawię jedną z podstawowych technik pozwalającą na swobodną wypowiedź "na gorąco". Jest ona niezwykle uniwersalna i elastyczna. Pozwala na budowanie autentycznych, naturalnych wypowiedzi. Opiera się o nasze emocje i doświadczenia. Pomaga przyciągnąć uwagę audytorium.</p>
                            <p>Jeśli chcesz nauczyć się tej metody - zapraszam Cię na warsztat, który odbędzie się na konferencji Level Up we Wrocławiu, w dniach 14 - 15.04.2018.</p>
                            <p><b>Epilog </b></p>
                            <p>Bili brawo, naprawdę im się podobało. "To działa" – pomyślałem uradowany. Byłem dumny, że się udało. </p>
